Configuring Kodi settings
I'll list some crucial settings within Kodi I would recommend you change before installing any addons, with an explanation as to why if the setting changed is not obvious.
Open Kodi and click settings. When you begin changing things, ensure "Expert" is selected (bottom-left) to view all settings.
Player > Language > Preferred audio language = English (Important - Prevent streams from defaulting to foreign audio)
Player > Language > Preferred subtitle language = English (Important - Prevents streams from defaulting to foreign subtitles)
Media > General > Show parent items = Off (Prevents a back button being shown that leads to your file manager when navigating a series' season later in the guide)
Interface > Regional = Configure regional settings to your preference
System > Display = Ensure correct resolution is set
System > Display > Use Fullscreen Window = On (if decent PC) or Off (if low-powered PC). Makes swapping between apps easier on Windows if on, but uses more resources.
System > Addons > Unknown Sources = On (Required to install 3rd party addons)
